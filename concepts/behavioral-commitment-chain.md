# Behavioral Commitment Chain (BCC)

The **Behavioral Commitment Chain (BCC)** is a cryptographic security protocol designed to intercept the non-deterministic, stochastic behavior of AI agents. It forces agents to cryptographically declare and lock-in their intended action states before they are allowed to mutate any database, external API, or transaction ledger.

## 1. The Core Mechanical Flow
Stochastic agents have fluid reasoning steps, making them vulnerable to prompt injections or sudden algorithmic drifts. The BCC neutralizes this by enforcing a hard, two-phase gate:

1.  **Declaration (Pre-Commitment):** Before executing an action (e.g. writing patient diagnosis to a DB, executing a financial trade), the agent serializes its proposed parameters into canonical JSON and computes a SHA-256 `intended_state_hash`. This hash, along with the agent ID and timestamp, is signed with point-of-origin private keys.
2.  **Enforcement (Execution Check):** At the moment of execution, the receiving proxy or smart contract evaluates the actual execution context against the signed commitment hash. If there is any drift or unauthorized state alteration, the transaction is immediately aborted.

## 2. Low-Friction Implementations
To prevent integration fatigue from agents and developers, the BCC is abstracted into:
*   [Mcip](mcip.md): Standardizes dynamic interface guardrails.
*   [did](did.md): Handles tethered hardware identities.
*   **BCC MCP Server:** A stdio JSON-RPC interface that exposes a simple `commit_action_intent` tool directly to the agent's context window.

## 3. Related Terms
